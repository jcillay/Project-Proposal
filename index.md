## Learning Super Mario Bros with Deep Reinforcement Learning
My project will involve deep reinforcement learning and nueral networks to complete a super mario brothers level. For the controlled project, I will work primarily on one level of Super Mario Brothers, to allow the agent to precisely learn its environment in a reasonable timeframe. The agent will learn slowly but, surely, learn the course until it is completed. I will work to implement this project on my own using pyTorch.

This project will be an application of using neural networks along with reinforcement and Q-learning. After the project has been implemented I plan to collect data on how the neural network performed within each episode and compare it to other implementations of a similar project.

Time permitted, there could also be a possibility of training the neural network to complete multiple levels in a reasonable time frame.

## Goals
1. Train an agent to learn a level of Super Mario Brothers.
2. Learn the basics of Q-learning and Reinforcement learning.
3. Collect data on how my implementation compares to others.
4. (Possible) Teach the agent to learn multiple levels of Super Mario.
